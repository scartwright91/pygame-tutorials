# Pygame tutorial: Projectiles

Tutorial explaining how to implement basic projectiles (on a single axis) and linear projectiles (defined between two points).

Video explanation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxU_R4B7A0o)

### Notes

Code for calculating linear projectiles is slightly different in the video to this code. The code here uses a simpler, more straightforward calculation.
